## Overview

RelayTerm is a web/mobile SSH terminal where SSH sessions live on a Rust backend, the browser/Tauri client only renders, and the terminal state is owned by a session orchestrator that survives client disconnects. Clients can detach and reconnect arbitrarily; on reconnect the backend replays missed output by sequence number. The terminal renderer is intentionally pluggable (xterm.js baseline, plus ghostty-web / restty / wterm experiments) so renderer choice doesn't affect session correctness.

**Primary users:** TODO — who connects and from which devices (desktop browser, Tauri desktop, Tauri Android), and at what frequency.
**Goals:** TODO — top 2-3 outcomes (e.g. "tabs survive flaky mobile networks," "single audited backend issues all SSH credentials," "renderer is swappable per device class").
**Non-goals:** TODO — things this is NOT (e.g. NOT a web-based VS Code; NOT an SSH proxy that exposes raw keys to clients).

## Architectural invariants (load-bearing)

These are normative. Drift from any of these is a spec bug, not an implementation freedom.

1. **Session ownership is on the backend.** The browser/Tauri client never holds the live `russh::Channel` or any private key.
2. **Terminal state ownership is on the orchestrator.** Sequence numbers, replay ring buffer, and (eventually) the libghostty-vt VT state machine live in the backend session crate, not in the renderer.
3. **Renderers are interchangeable.** A renderer is allowed to render and to capture user input. It is NOT allowed to: persist state across disconnects, decide auth, or reorder output.
4. **The client may disappear at any moment.** All correctness invariants must hold across `client_dropped → reconnect → resume_at_sequence_n`.
5. **Backend-issued credentials only.** SSH private keys are generated and stored encrypted on the backend; clients receive nothing more than a session token. Known-hosts checks happen on the backend.

## Data model

> Source of truth: `apps/backend/migrations/`. This section is the human-readable summary; auto-update via `/agents spec-sync` when schema changes.

### Entities

Source of truth is `apps/backend/migrations/` and `crates/relayterm-core/`. Initial set (v1):

- **user** (`users`) — owner identity. Email is the login handle; auth credentials (passkeys / dev-mode password) are layered on top in a later migration.
- **host** (`hosts`) — a reachable SSH endpoint: `display_name`, `hostname`, `port`, `default_username`. A host carries NO credentials.
- **ssh_identity** (`ssh_identities`) — a backend-managed credential record (keypair + algorithm metadata). Bound to a `user`, NOT to a host. `encrypted_private_key` is opaque ciphertext produced by the vault crate (XChaCha20-Poly1305 with a 32-byte master key from typed config); the envelope carries a magic prefix and version byte so future schemes can be introduced without schema churn. Plaintext private bytes never leave the vault and never appear in API responses or logs.
- **server_profile** (`server_profiles`) — the user-facing binding of a `host` to an `ssh_identity`. This is the row a user picks from a "connect to..." list. Carries optional `username_override` and `tags`. Splitting host + identity from this binding lets a single key be reused across many hosts.
- **known_host_entry** (`known_host_entries`) — pinned public key per host. Every `check_server_key` decision in the SSH layer must consult this table; `trusted_at` is set when the user confirms a fingerprint, `revoked_at` when the entry is invalidated.
- **terminal_session** (`terminal_sessions`) — long-lived SSH session METADATA only. The live `russh::Channel`, replay ring buffer, libghostty-vt parser state, and PTY descriptors are owned by the orchestrator at runtime and are NEVER persisted. `cols`/`rows` are the last requested PTY size — purely a hint for resume. Status is one of `starting`, `active`, `detached`, `closed`; `starting` is the placeholder set on `POST /api/v1/terminal-sessions` BEFORE a real PTY exists. `active` is set when a live PTY runtime is bound; `detached` is set during the bounded `DETACHED_LIVE_PTY_TTL` reconnect window after the last client leaves.
- **terminal_session_attachment** (`terminal_session_attachments`) — one row per historical client attachment. `last_seen_seq` records the last sequence number that attachment acknowledged before detaching, used for resume bookkeeping. The replay buffer itself stays in memory.
- **session_event** (`session_events`) — append-only lifecycle log for a `terminal_session`: `created`, `attached`, `detached`, `reattached`, `resized`, `replay_started`, `replay_completed`, `closed`. NOT a per-output log.
- **audit_event** (`audit_events`) — append-only security log: auth outcomes, key vault access, host-key mismatch, profile/identity mutations, session open/close. `actor_id` is nullable for pre-auth events.
- **user_password** / **user_session** (auth tables) — see "Production authentication" below; full schema in [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md). `user_passwords` carries one row per user with the Argon2id PHC string. `user_sessions` carries one row per active opaque session token, keyed by SHA-256 `token_hash`; the plaintext `session_token` is never stored.
- **terminal_recording_chunks** / **terminal_recording_markers** — append-only durable recording of PTY OUTPUT bytes plus metadata markers. Chunk `payload` is opaque renderer-neutral bytes; full schema and redaction rules in [`docs/spec/recording.md`](docs/spec/recording.md) and the binding [`docs/terminal-recording.md`](docs/terminal-recording.md).

### ER diagram

TODO: Mermaid ER diagram. Update when entities change.

## Surfaces

This index points to the per-surface long-form contract under [`docs/spec/`](docs/spec/). Drift between this index and the area docs is a spec bug — file a doc fix.

### SSH credential and trust surfaces — see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md)

- **Credential creation contract** — `POST /api/v1/ssh-identities` generates an Ed25519 keypair backend-side; response carries the public OpenSSH line + SHA-256 fingerprint, never `encrypted_private_key`, never plaintext PEM, never vault internals. Failure modes 400/401/503 (static body); plaintext private bytes only ever exist inside `VaultService::generate_ssh_identity` and are wiped before return.
- **Host-key preflight + known-host trust contract** — `POST /api/v1/server-profiles/:id/host-key-preflight` captures the host key during KEX and disconnects WITHOUT attempting authentication (no client signature is ever sent to an unverified peer). `POST /api/v1/server-profiles/:id/trust-host-key` requires the caller's `expected_fingerprint` to match the freshly-captured fingerprint AND refuses to silently re-trust a revoked entry. Wire-stable status set: `unknown`, `trusted`, `changed`. Idempotent. The original incident analysis is in [`docs/agent/encountered-lessons.md`](docs/agent/encountered-lessons.md) (2026-04-29).
- **Authenticated SSH credential check contract** — `POST /api/v1/server-profiles/:id/auth-check` confirms a configured `ssh_identity` actually authenticates against the target. Wire-stable status: `authentication_succeeded`, `authentication_failed`, `host_key_unknown`, `host_key_changed`, `connection_failed`. The check NEVER opens a PTY, runs a shell, or executes a command. Hard outer timeout (default 25s) and a process-wide concurrency semaphore (default 4) bound outbound network exposure.

### Terminal lifecycle, transport, renderers, and UI — see [`docs/spec/terminal.md`](docs/spec/terminal.md) (renderer adapter contracts in [`docs/spec/terminal-adapters.md`](docs/spec/terminal-adapters.md))

- **Terminal-session lifecycle** — `POST /api/v1/terminal-sessions` creates metadata in `starting`; the live PTY-bearing implementation transitions to `active` / `detached` / `closed`. Owner-scoped; foreign / missing ids collapse to a byte-identical 404. `409 conflict { entity: "host_key" }` if no trusted pin exists for the profile's host. Idempotent close.
- **Terminal WebSocket attach/detach contract** — `GET /api/v1/terminal-sessions/:id/ws` runs through `AuthenticatedUser`; control plane is JSON, hot terminal data plane is the binary `RTB1` envelope (`Output` server→client, `Input` client→server, ≤1 MiB payload). Wire-stable JSON message types and error codes append-never-renumber. Detached attachment cleanup writes `detached_at` even on abrupt socket exit.
- **Live SSH PTY bridge contract** — describes how the orchestrator binds `russh::Channel` to the wire, the `DETACHED_LIVE_PTY_TTL` reconnect window, the dev workbench launcher, and the renderer comparison diagnostic surface.
- **Output sequence + in-memory replay buffer contract** — every `Output` frame carries a monotonic per-session `seq` starting at 1. Bounded ring (default `max_frames = 1024` AND `max_bytes = 1 MiB`), FIFO eviction, the most recent frame is always retained. Replay handshake on attach: `replay_start` → buffered `output` → `replay_end`, or a single `replay_window_lost` if the bookmark predates the buffer.
- **Frontend `terminal-core` contract** — TS mirror of the wire protocol; renderer-neutral `TerminalRenderer` interface; `TerminalSessionClient` lifecycle state machine. Renderers are interchangeable adapters (xterm baseline + experimental ghostty-web / restty / wterm).
- **Renderer adapters** (full contracts in [`docs/spec/terminal-adapters.md`](docs/spec/terminal-adapters.md)) — four adapters, each documented with package layout, contract, neutrality re-affirmation, dev-lab UI, and production-bundle tree-shaking behavior. xterm.js is the production baseline; ghostty-web / restty / wterm are dev-only experimental and tree-shaken from production. Renderer-specific knobs go behind a local `<renderer>Only` escape hatch.
- **Production terminal UI** — launch UI; sessions list/status; terminal settings foundation; viewport controls; **paste safety** (shape-based policy: `safe` / `confirm` / `blocked`; metadata-only panels; tested with sentinel-string redaction); active-terminal local recovery via `(session_id, last_seen_seq)` `sessionStorage` pointer; status refresh and stale-session handling.

### Inventory views, dashboard, and lifecycle implementation — see [`docs/spec/inventory.md`](docs/spec/inventory.md)

- **Read-only inventory views** for hosts, SSH identities, server profiles; detail panels; client-side search + tag filters.
- **Setup-action UIs** — SSH identity generation; host & server-profile creation; host-key preflight & trust UI; SSH auth-check UI.
- **Dashboard summary + recent activity** — at-a-glance counts, an honest setup checklist, and the current-user audit feed (`actor_id = caller`, NULL-actor pre-auth events deliberately excluded).
- **Server profile disable / enable** — backend routes, lifecycle audit (`server_profile_created` / `server_profile_disabled` / `server_profile_enabled`), current-user audit-events read API, frontend UI. Implementation status, route shapes, and audit payload contracts live in the area doc; the normative policy stays inline below.

### Production web app shell — see [`docs/spec/web-shell.md`](docs/spec/web-shell.md)

- Sidebar / topbar / view chrome; `AppShell.svelte` view dispatch; `AppViewId` discriminator; URL-driven view routing helpers. Production shell components MUST NOT import from `lib/dev/` or any experimental renderer adapter; isolation is pinned by `tests/appShellIsolation.test.ts`.

### Durable terminal recording and replay — see [`docs/spec/recording.md`](docs/spec/recording.md) (and the binding [`docs/terminal-recording.md`](docs/terminal-recording.md))

- Recording is OFF by default and config-gated; production-mode boot refuses recording-enabled with no recording master key (the recording master key is SEPARATE from the SSH-identity vault master key). Output bytes only; input is NOT recorded in v1. Persisted format is renderer-neutral. Owner-scoped reads; chunk bytes cross the wire only as `data_b64`. Retention sweep (Stage A startup-only + Stage B periodic advisory-locked worker) emits `recording_purged` audit rows with `actor_id = NULL` and public-only payloads.

## Behavior contracts

- **Reconnect replay**: when a client reconnects with `(session_id, last_seen_seq)`, the backend MUST send all events with `seq > last_seen_seq` from the ring buffer in order, then resume live streaming. If `last_seen_seq` is older than the ring buffer's tail, the backend returns a `replay_window_lost` error and the client must request a full re-render or close the session. **Status:** the in-memory replay buffer is in place and the wire path is live. See [`docs/spec/terminal.md`](docs/spec/terminal.md) → "Output sequence + in-memory replay buffer contract" for the per-frame contract, the bounded buffer policy, and the explicit non-durability guarantees.
- **Renderer swap**: the user MAY change the active renderer for a session at any time. The new renderer subscribes from the current sequence number; no replay is required.
- **Session lifecycle**: a session enters `detached` immediately on client drop, NOT after a timeout. A `detached` session continues to receive PTY output and append to the ring buffer until the `DETACHED_LIVE_PTY_TTL` window expires or an explicit close arrives. Reconnect inside the window resumes via `last_seen_seq`. Audit log records every state transition. See [`docs/spec/terminal.md`](docs/spec/terminal.md) → "Detached-session TTL contract" for the full policy.
- **Host-key change**: on `check_server_key` mismatch, the backend rejects the connection, logs an `audit_event`, and surfaces the mismatch to the user; it does NOT silently update the known_hosts entry. The preflight + trust-host-key endpoints (see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) → "Host-key preflight + known-host trust contract") implement this for the pre-session probe; the same rule applies to live sessions once they land.
- **Key vault access**: the encrypted private key is decrypted only inside the SSH session task. Decrypted bytes never cross a boundary (no log, no IPC payload, no DB write).

## Inventory lifecycle and destructive-action policy

This section is normative. It defines the safe lifecycle for every inventory entity and the rules a future destructive surface (delete, disable, archive, revoke) MUST follow. Drift from these rules is a spec bug, not an implementation freedom.

**Status today (load-bearing — read before adding any destructive surface).** No production route or UI **deletes** or archives any inventory record. The lifecycle moves wired today are:

- `POST /api/v1/terminal-sessions/:id/close` — terminal sessions reach the `closed` terminal state.
- `POST /api/v1/server-profiles/:id/disable` and `POST /api/v1/server-profiles/:id/enable` — Stamp / clear `server_profiles.disabled_at`. Disabled profiles refuse new launches, auth-check, host-key preflight / trust. Existing live sessions are unaffected. Each successful create / enabled→disabled / disabled→enabled transition appends one `audit_events` row (`server_profile_created` / `server_profile_disabled` / `server_profile_enabled`). Frontend UI for disable / enable has landed. Implementation detail (route shapes, payload contract, idempotency rules, fail-closed audit-failure policy, current-user audit-events read API, frontend UI) lives in [`docs/spec/inventory.md`](docs/spec/inventory.md).
- `known_host_entries.revoked_at` — column exists; no route or UI yet writes it. The trust route already refuses to silently re-trust a revoked fingerprint (two-layer guard: route check + `record_trusted` SQL `WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`).

Everything else (`hosts`, `ssh_identities`, `server_profiles` deletion, `terminal_sessions` outside `close`, audit/session events) has no destructive surface. The schema enforces FK `RESTRICT` on the load-bearing references; an attempt to delete a referenced row from the DB layer would already fail. The policy below is what MUST be true *before* any destructive route or UI lands.

### Per-entity lifecycle states

| Entity | States today | Future states | Destructive surface today | FK to children |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | `active` (no other state) | none planned in v1 | none | `hosts` (CASCADE), `ssh_identities` (CASCADE), `server_profiles` (CASCADE), `terminal_sessions` (CASCADE), `audit_events.actor_id` (SET NULL) |
| `hosts` | `active` (no flag column) | `active` only — delete-when-zero-references | none | `server_profiles.host_id` (RESTRICT), `known_host_entries.host_id` (CASCADE) |
| `ssh_identities` | `active` (no flag column) | `active` only — delete-when-zero-references | none | `server_profiles.ssh_identity_id` (RESTRICT) |
| `server_profiles` | `active` \| `disabled` (`disabled_at` column) | unchanged; delete only after disable AND zero session references | `POST /:id/disable`, `POST /:id/enable` | `terminal_sessions.server_profile_id` (RESTRICT) |
| `known_host_entries` | `unknown` (no `trusted_at`), `trusted` (`trusted_at` set, `revoked_at IS NULL`), `revoked` (`revoked_at` set) | unchanged; explicit operator-only unrevoke much later | column-level `revoked_at` only — no route yet | none |
| `terminal_sessions` | `starting`, `active`, `detached`, `closed` (CHECK constraint) | unchanged | `POST /:id/close` — idempotent, terminal | `terminal_session_attachments.session_id` (CASCADE), `session_events.session_id` (CASCADE) |
| `terminal_session_attachments` | open (`detached_at IS NULL`), detached (`detached_at` set) | unchanged | row update on detach (manager-internal); never deleted via UI | none |
| `session_events`, `audit_events` | append-only | unchanged | none — immutable | none |

`users` deletion is intentionally out of scope for v1. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` shape exists for operator/test use only; no API surface accepts a user delete.

### Delete vs disable / archive policy

1. **Default user-facing destructive action for `server_profiles` is `disable`, not delete.** Disable blocks NEW launches; existing live sessions keep running until they close on their own (operator close, remote shell exit, or PTY teardown). A re-enable returns the profile to launchable.
2. **`hosts` and `ssh_identities` are deletable only when zero `server_profiles` reference them.** This matches the schema's FK `RESTRICT`. The route MUST classify the refusal at the application layer — a clean 409 BEFORE attempting the DELETE — so the client gets a typed error (`409 conflict { entity: "server_profile", count: N }`) instead of a generic constraint violation. Production UI MUST surface "remove the N referencing profiles first" rather than "try again."
3. **`server_profiles` are deletable only when zero `terminal_sessions` reference them, AND the profile was already `disabled`** (preferred). Closed sessions count toward the reference total — closed-session metadata is historical and protective. If hard-delete on a referenced profile is ever needed, it is admin-only, not a user-facing action.
4. **`terminal_sessions` are NEVER deleted from the user UI.** Once `closed`, they are historical metadata. The user lists, views, and audits them. Any cascade or sweep that drops session rows is admin-only, future-only, and explicit. Inventory deletion (host/identity/profile) MUST NOT cascade-delete sessions — `RESTRICT` is the policy and the schema agrees.
5. **`known_host_entries` are revoked, never hard-deleted from user UI.** Hard delete is admin-only future work. Revoke is non-recoverable from the user surface; an explicit operator unrevoke flow may land later as a separate, deliberate slice (see `docs/agent/encountered-lessons.md` 2026-04-29).
6. **`session_events` and `audit_events` are never deleted from any surface.** They are append-only forensic logs; an admin retention sweep is future work and out of scope for v1.

### Reference / integrity policy

- **Host delete**: requires `0` `server_profiles` referencing the host. Cascade-deletes `known_host_entries` for the host (DB-level `ON DELETE CASCADE`). This is intentional — pins live with the host and a deleted host's pins have no meaning.
- **SSH identity delete**: requires `0` `server_profiles` referencing the identity. The encrypted private-key bytes are wiped at the DB layer when the row is removed; no copy of `encrypted_private_key` exists outside the row (vault decrypts only into ephemeral memory in the SSH session / preflight task and zeroizes on drop).
- **Server profile disable**: no reference check needed. Existing live `terminal_sessions` are unaffected. The launch route refuses to start a new session against a disabled profile with `409 conflict { entity: "server_profile", reason: "disabled" }`.
- **Server profile delete**: requires `disabled` AND `0` `terminal_sessions` referencing the profile (any status). Two-layer policy: the route emits a clean 409 BEFORE attempting DELETE; the schema's `RESTRICT` is the second-line backstop.
- **Typed-409 entity field convention**: the wire `entity` value on a `409 conflict` envelope uses the singular table-row form (`server_profile`, `terminal_session`, `host_key`). This matches the existing `409 conflict { entity: "host_key" }` and `409 conflict { entity: "terminal_session" }` shapes in the host-key-trust and terminal-session-create contracts. New destructive routes MUST follow this form so client error handling stays uniform.
- **Active session at the moment of profile disable**: the live session continues. Disable is a launch-time gate, not a runtime kill switch. Operator-driven session kill remains `POST /api/v1/terminal-sessions/:id/close`.
- **`audit_events.actor_id` orphans to `NULL`** when a user is deleted (schema `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Audit history survives user deletion, with the actor anonymised. This is the only inventory action that nullifies a reference; everything else uses `RESTRICT` or `CASCADE` deliberately.

### Session-history policy

- A `closed` `terminal_session` row is a permanent historical record. Users can list and view it but cannot delete it.
- The row's `server_profile_id` and `owner_id` references must remain stable for the row's lifetime. This is why the schema uses `RESTRICT` on `server_profile_id` and `CASCADE` on `owner_id` — the row dies only with its owner.
- When a profile is disabled or deleted, historical session rows that reference it stay readable. The list UI MUST handle a session whose underlying profile is gone (post-delete) without crashing — render a stable session id, status, timestamps, and a "(profile removed)" placeholder for the profile name.
- `terminal_session_attachments` and `session_events` cascade-delete with their session row. This is correct: they are per-session telemetry and have no meaning detached from the session. They are NOT exposed as their own deletable surface.

### Known-host revocation policy

- The state machine is `unknown → trusted → revoked` (with `unknown` returning to itself if the operator never confirms). `revoked` is reachable only via a deliberate operator action; the production UI does NOT surface revoke today.
- A revoked entry is **never silently re-trusted**. The trust route enforces this with two layers (route guard + `record_trusted` SQL), and the classifier filters revoked rows out of the `trusted` / `changed` classification (a revoked-and-reappearing key surfaces as `unknown`, not `trusted`). See `docs/agent/encountered-lessons.md` 2026-04-29 for the original incident analysis.
- Recovery from `revoked` is an explicit operator workflow that does NOT exist in v1. A future "unrevoke" route MUST be admin-only, audit-logged, and require an explicit fingerprint match — no convenience UX that lets an operator click through revocation.
- `known_host_entries` cascade-delete with their host (schema `ON DELETE CASCADE`). This is correct: pins are scoped to the host and have no meaning after the host is gone.
- Hard delete of a known-host entry without deleting its host is admin-only future work.

### Audit-event expectations

The `audit_events.kind` enum already anticipates `server_profile_created`, `server_profile_updated`, `server_profile_disabled`, `server_profile_enabled`, `server_profile_deleted`, `ssh_identity_created`, `ssh_identity_deleted`, `host_key_accepted`, `host_key_mismatch`, and `host_key_revoked`. New destructive routes MUST extend the enum (with a paired migration to the `audit_events_kind_chk` CHECK and the `AuditEventKind` Rust enum) when they introduce a new lifecycle action.

`server_profile_created`, `server_profile_disabled`, and `server_profile_enabled` are the only kinds wired today. See [`docs/spec/inventory.md`](docs/spec/inventory.md) → "Server profile lifecycle audit" for the payload contract, idempotency rules, and fail-closed failure policy.

The currently-missing kinds are:

- `host_created`, `host_updated` — neither variant exists yet. The host CRUD routes do not write audit events today; that is its own gap. When host create/update lands, add the matching kinds (and corresponding `host_deleted`).
- `host_deleted` — required when host delete lands.
- (`host_key_revoked` already exists; reuse it for the revoke route.)

The auth-related kinds `login_succeeded`, `login_failed`, and `logout_succeeded` ARE already present in `audit_events_kind_chk` (per the original `20260428000009_audit_events.sql` migration) but no route emits them today. The forthcoming auth slice MUST NOT add a duplicate migration for these names. The auth slice DOES add new kinds (`first_user_created`, `password_changed`, `session_revoked`, `sessions_revoked`) — see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) → "Audit events" for the full list and the paired migration requirement.

Rules every destructive lifecycle action MUST follow:

1. **Successful destructive action writes exactly one audit event** with `actor_id = caller`, an appropriate `kind`, and a payload containing the target id and target kind. The `target_id` field on the payload is required so cross-entity audit queries are tractable.
2. **Failed destructive attempts that are security-relevant SHOULD audit.** A revoke-then-trust attempt, a cross-user delete (which already collapses to a 404 to avoid existence leak), and a delete refused for FK reasons in a context that suggests probing (large burst, repeated unknowns) are candidates. Routine 409s (delete blocked by visible references in the caller's own inventory) MAY skip audit to keep the log signal-rich.
3. **Audit payloads contain public metadata only.** Allowed: target id, target kind, caller id, fingerprints (public), `key_type`, `name`, timestamps, reference counts (e.g. `referencing_profile_count`), reason codes. **Forbidden:** `encrypted_private_key`, plaintext private-key bytes, raw russh error text, peer banners, vault internals (master key, nonce, version byte), terminal I/O (input keystrokes, output bytes), full URLs with query strings that could carry secrets, the `client_info` blob from `terminal_session_attachments` (operator-supplied User-Agent — reference attachments by `id` only).
4. **For `ssh_identity_deleted`** the payload MAY retain `name`, `key_type`, `fingerprint_sha256`, and `created_at` so the audit row remains readable after the underlying identity row is gone. The `encrypted_private_key` bytes are NEVER copied into audit.
5. **For `host_deleted`** the payload MAY retain `display_name`, `hostname`, `port`, `default_username`, and a count of cascaded `known_host_entries` so audit history records the operation precisely.
6. **For `server_profile_disabled` / `server_profile_enabled`** the payload includes `target_id` and the new state. No reason field is required in v1; an optional operator-supplied note is future work.
7. **`session_events` are not a substitute for `audit_events`.** Session events are per-session lifecycle telemetry and stay scoped to that session row. Audit events span the system and survive cascade-delete of session telemetry.

### UI implications

- No edit / delete / archive UI exists today outside the terminal-session close path. The production app shell renders read-only inventory detail panels by design except for the server-profile disable / enable controls described in [`docs/spec/inventory.md`](docs/spec/inventory.md) → "Server profile disable / enable UI (landed)".
- Future destructive UI MUST be **explicit, confirmable, and auditable**. A confirmation dialog is required for every destructive action; the confirmation MUST name the target (display name + id suffix), the action verb, and the consequence ("this profile will stop accepting new launches; existing live sessions are unaffected").
- Confirmation dialogs and audit views render **public metadata only**. The redaction rule from `lib/api/` parsers extends here — no `private_key` / `encrypted_private_key` field appears in any DOM string, formatted preview, or copy string. The existing sentinel-string redaction tests in the SSH-identity views are the pattern to follow.
- Routing rule (already established): no secret material, terminal data, or session payloads in URLs. This applies to confirmation dialog hashes too — destructive confirmation goes through component state, not URL params.
- Disabled `server_profiles` render with a clear `disabled` badge in the inventory list and detail panel. The Launch button is rendered disabled with an honest tooltip ("this profile is disabled; enable it to launch a new terminal"). The dashboard checklist's `launch-terminal` row stays count-inferable — disabled profiles do NOT change the count semantics.
- Closed terminal sessions remain visible and read-only in the sessions list. The list MUST handle a session whose `server_profile_id` no longer resolves (post-delete) without crashing — render a stable session id, status, timestamps, and a "(profile removed)" placeholder.
- A session whose underlying profile is `disabled` (but still resolvable) renders the profile name with a `(disabled)` suffix in the sessions list and detail panel. The session itself is unaffected by disable — `active`/`detached` sessions keep streaming and the operator may still close them — so the UI signals the disabled-profile context without implying the session has stopped. Re-enabling the profile clears the suffix on the next refresh.

### Implementation status and order

Current implementation status (what has landed: server-profile disable/enable backend + audit emission + read API + frontend UI) and the staged plan for the remaining destructive surfaces (server-profile delete, host delete, ssh-identity delete, known-host revoke, stale-row sweepers, admin tooling, operator unrevoke + admin hard-delete) are tracked in [`docs/spec/inventory.md`](docs/spec/inventory.md) → "Future implementation order". Each numbered step inherits the standard "definition of done" checklist (tests, sqlx prepare on schema change, audit event reachable, owner-scoping, redaction posture).

## Production authentication

> Full normative contract: [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md). Operator deployment guide: [`docs/production-auth.md`](docs/production-auth.md). Smoke procedure: [`docs/auth-smoke.md`](docs/auth-smoke.md). Worked config templates: [`docs/config-examples/relayterm.dev.example.toml`](docs/config-examples/relayterm.dev.example.toml) and [`docs/config-examples/relayterm.production.example.toml`](docs/config-examples/relayterm.production.example.toml).

The summary below is load-bearing: any change must keep all of these invariants true. Drift goes through `docs/spec/auth.md` first, never through code.

- **Auth mode model.** `auth.mode = production` and `auth.mode = dev` run the same real-auth code path. Mode selects only the boot-time validation envelope: production REQUIRES a configured session signing key source, non-empty `auth.allowed_origins`, and `auth.cookie_secure = true`; dev relaxes all three. There is no runtime "skip auth" branch — the legacy `DevUser` extractor and `dev@relayterm.local` fixture user are gone.
- **Opaque server-side sessions.** The wire never carries a JWT. Every authenticated request is gated by an opaque random `session_token` (32 bytes, URL-safe-no-pad base64 → 43 ASCII chars) bound to a `user_sessions` row. The plaintext `session_token` is generated once at session creation, written to a `Set-Cookie` header, and dropped. Storage and lookup are by SHA-256 `token_hash` only — `user_sessions.token_hash` is the load-bearing column, and the plaintext is treated like vault private-key bytes (visible on exactly one wire surface, never persisted, never logged).
- **Cookie-backed browser auth.** The cookie is `relayterm_session`, `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure` (in production), with optional `Domain=` for subdomain sharing. Default expiry is `created_at + 30 days` hard-expire. Logout / revoke writes a `session_revoked` audit row and removes the row from `user_sessions`.
- **CSRF / `Origin` guard for browser writes.** Every state-changing browser-write route runs the shared `CsrfGuard` extractor (`relayterm_api::CsrfGuard`) BEFORE any DB / auth / body work. Wire policy is `403 csrf_origin_mismatch`; `GET`s are exempt. Allowed origins are a byte-equality allow-list configured per-deployment. The handler MUST NEVER echo the offered `Origin` value in the wire body OR the operator-side `warn!` line.
- **First-user bootstrap.** Production refuses to start with no row in `user_passwords` AND no `auth.first_user_bootstrap_token`. With both: `POST /api/v1/auth/bootstrap` accepts the bootstrap token + email + password, creates the first user, hashes the password with Argon2id at `OWASP_2023` parameters (`m=19456`, `t=2`, `p=1`), writes a `first_user_created` audit row, and the operator unsets the bootstrap token on next deploy. There is no second-user bootstrap path; admin / multi-user is out of scope for v1.
- **Password authentication.** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` runs through CSRF guard + payload validation + the in-memory `LoginThrottler` (5 failures / 15-minute window → 15-minute block, keyed on `normalize_login_identifier(&email)` only — no `Retry-After`, no IP keying yet) BEFORE the user lookup. Both unknown-email AND wrong-password branches `record_failure`. Success records `record_success`, mints a session, writes a `login_succeeded` audit row.
- **Password and session management surfaces.**
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` — verifies current password, persists a fresh Argon2id PHC hash, revokes every OTHER session for the caller (the current cookie stays valid), emits `password_changed` audit (payload carries `revoked_other_sessions: u64` only — never the plaintext password, never any hash, never any cookie value).
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions` — current-user-scoped at the SQL layer; returns only safe metadata (`id`, `created_at`, `last_seen_at`, `expires_at`, optional truncated `user_agent`). Never carries `session_token`, `token_hash`, or `client_info` blobs.
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/:id/revoke` and `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/revoke-all-except-current` — owner-scoped; emit `session_revoked` / `sessions_revoked` audit rows; the second route deliberately keeps the caller's current session alive.
  - `last_seen_at` is stamped inline on every successful `AuthenticatedUser` extraction; failure logs `warn!` with the session id only — never the cookie value, the `session_token`, the `token_hash`, the password hash, or repository internals.
- **Redaction boundary (security-critical).** The plaintext `session_token`, the `token_hash`, the password (clear and PHC-hashed), and the `relayterm_session` cookie value MUST never appear in:
  - `tracing::*` lines (any level — including `warn!` / `error!`).
  - `audit_events.payload` rows.
  - `Display` / `Serialize` impls of session / password types.
  - Thrown `Error.message` / panic strings / any HTTP response body.
  - `data-*` attributes / frontend `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` / any DOM string.
  - The current-user audit feed (`recent_for_actor`) — pre-auth events with `actor_id IS NULL` are ALSO excluded by SQL filter so a probe pattern cannot leak via the user-facing feed.
  - Sentinel-string tests in `crates/relayterm-api/tests/api.rs` (the `AUDIT_FORBIDDEN_SUBSTRINGS` helper) are the redaction backstop on every emission path.
- **Frontend auth UI plan.** Login / logout / password-change / session-management panels live in the Settings view; no auth UI shows the plaintext `session_token`, `token_hash`, or any password-shaped field. Errors collapse through `describeLoadError` so transport / operator detail cannot leak into the rendered string.
- **Forward compatibility.** The session shape carries an enum-tagged credential type so passkeys / WebAuthn can land later without a session-shape migration. Passkeys, password reset, IP-aware throttling, and admin / cross-user session views are deliberately out of scope for v1.

The full per-route contract, audit-payload schema, security-properties test list, and implementation order live in [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md). The boot-time validator (`Config::validate_auth` in `apps/backend/src/config.rs`) is the executable contract for the validation envelope; the integration tests in `crates/relayterm-api/tests/api.rs` are the executable contract for the runtime surface.

## Integration points

- **PostgreSQL** — primary store for users, sessions, audit log, key vault. sqlx connection pool; `runtime-tokio-rustls`.
- **Vault master key** — 32-byte secret loaded once at boot, supplied via `vault.master_key_b64` (config / `RELAYTERM_VAULT__MASTER_KEY_B64` env) or `vault.master_key_file`. Exactly one source must resolve, or the backend refuses to start. There is no fallback to a randomly generated key — that would orphan all previously stored ciphertext after a restart. Setting `vault.enabled = false` disables backend-generated identities (the POST route returns 503) and lets the rest of the API run.
- **Traefik** — reverse proxy in front of the backend; terminates TLS; routes `/api/*` and `/ws/*`. Self-hosted Compose deployment shape lives in [`docs/deployment/docker-compose.md`](docs/deployment/docker-compose.md) and the operator runbook lives in [`docs/deployment/production-runbook.md`](docs/deployment/production-runbook.md).
- **WireGuard** (optional) — used only when the backend lives on a remote box and SSH targets are reachable only via the WireGuard mesh.
- **Object storage** — TODO if the project ever needs file upload/download via SCP/SFTP. Out of scope for v1.
- **Passkeys / WebAuthn** — deferred. v1 ships password-only authentication with opaque server-side sessions in Postgres bound to an `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookie. Real cookie-backed auth runs in both `auth.mode = dev` and `auth.mode = production`; see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) for the validation envelope each mode enforces and the forward-compatible session shape that lets passkeys land later without a session-shape change.
- **Tauri shells (desktop + mobile)** — separate release tracks under `apps/desktop/` and `apps/mobile/`. Both shells consume the built `apps/web` SPA. v1 has no automated build/release pipeline for either shell; iOS is explicitly later than Android. See "Out of scope (v1)" below for the full list of deferred Tauri / mobile work.

## Out of scope (v1)

TODO — explicit list of features deferred so the agent doesn't "helpfully" implement them. Likely:

- SCP/SFTP file transfer surface.
- Multi-user shared sessions / "screen-share."
- Public-cloud-hosted multi-tenant deployment (v1 is single-tenant Docker Compose).
- iOS Tauri build (Android first; iOS later). The Tauri desktop and mobile shells (`apps/desktop/`, `apps/mobile/`) ship with no automated CI/build pipeline yet. (Staged plan: [`docs/deployment/tauri-ci-release-plan.md`](docs/deployment/tauri-ci-release-plan.md).)
- libghostty-vt state engine swap (planned; xterm.js drives the baseline). The xterm.js baseline adapter (`@relayterm/terminal-xterm`) and the experimental ghostty-web (`@relayterm/terminal-ghostty-web`), restty (`@relayterm/terminal-restty`), and wterm (`@relayterm/terminal-wterm`) adapters have all landed under `packages/terminal-<name>/`.
- Multi-user / team authentication, role-based access control, and an admin / operator surface. v1 is single-user self-hosted; see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) for the rationale.
- Email-based password reset / "forgot password" flow. Self-hosted operators have DB-level recovery in v1; mail transport is its own scope.
- Passkey / WebAuthn registration and authentication. Forward-compatible with the v1 session shape; deliberately deferred.
- Admin / cross-user session view (`/auth/sessions` is current-user only by design). The current-user Settings session-management UI has now landed — see [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) → "Implementation order".
- Kubernetes / Helm / Nomad, multi-node HA, zero-downtime rolling deploys, image signing, SBOM / vulnerability scanning, registry retention automation, multi-arch images, managed-secrets integrations, or backup automation — see the [`docs/deployment/production-runbook.md`](docs/deployment/production-runbook.md) deferred-work ledger.

## Open questions

TODO — known ambiguities for the owner to resolve. Each: question, options considered, current default if any.

- Replay buffer policy: fixed bytes vs fixed events vs time-window? Default: TODO. (Live default: `max_frames = 1024` AND `max_bytes = 1 MiB`; see [`docs/spec/terminal.md`](docs/spec/terminal.md) → "Output sequence + in-memory replay buffer contract".)
- How long does a `detached` session linger before auto-close? **Default**: `relayterm_terminal::DETACHED_LIVE_PTY_TTL = 30s`. In-memory only (lost on backend restart). See [`docs/spec/terminal.md`](docs/spec/terminal.md) → "Detached-session TTL contract" for the full lifecycle.
- Should the renderer choice be per-session or per-device? Default: per-device.
- Session expiry policy: hard-expire vs sliding-window? **Default (v1)**: `hard_expire` at `created_at + 30 days`. Reconsider only if UX demands it; sliding-window introduces a re-issue race for marginal benefit. See [`docs/spec/auth.md`](docs/spec/auth.md) → "Session model".
- Login throttle thresholds: bucket size and refill rate per `(remote_addr, email)` and per `email`. **Resolved (v1)**: `LoginThrottleConfig::V1_DEFAULT` = 5 failures / 15-minute sliding window → 15-minute block, keyed on the **normalized email only** (IP-aware keying deferred until `ConnectInfo` is plumbed). Constants live in code (`crates/relayterm-auth/src/throttle.rs`); a config knob is deliberately not added in v1 — the policy is single-tenant defensible and any tuning is a deploy redeploy. The test rig drives a tight bucket via per-test `Arc<LoginThrottler>` injection on `AppState`.
